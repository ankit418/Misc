                            A driving system for controlling the speed of a wheelchair
A driving system for a powered wheelchair (100) comprising a hand lever (101), a prime mover (102), and a two-speed gearbox (103). The prime mover (102) is connected to the hand lever (101) and the two-speed gearbox (103) is connected to the prime mover (102), so that when the hand lever (101), is pushed by an user of the wheelchair(100), the rotational movement of an input shaft (112) is transferred to an output shaft (113) through a first pinion gear (107) and a first gear (109) such that a male dog clutch (105) and a female dog clutch (106) are engaged and a relative movement between the output shaft (113) and a freewheel (111) allows the freewheel (111) to rotate in an anticlockwise direction thereby providing lesser gear ratio in the first gear (109) to induce low torque on a wheel shaft (100a) of the wheelchair (100).

 , Description:PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:
[0001]	The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:
Technical Field of the Invention
[0002]	The present invention relates to a powered wheelchair with a two-speedgearbox for achieving a desired mixture of low speeds for climbing slopes/hills or moving over obstacles, and to operate at highspeeds when on flat surface.
Background of the Invention
[0003]	In general, velocity of a wheelchair is limited in speed, in a typical speed range of zero to less than six miles per hour. Although the lower speed range of the wheelchair is beneficial for certain wheelchair functions, such as slope/hillclimbing, or powering over obstacles, the low speed range is however not always preferable on a flat terrain surface.
[0004]	Further, wheelchair operators often demand higher speed range of about eight to ten miles per hour range, or higher on the flat terrain surface..However, at the same time these wheelchair operators do not, want to sacrifice the low speed ranges (which are requiredfor slope/hill climbing) in order to achieve higher speed range on flat terrain surface. Thus, the ordinary powered wheelchair is incapable of achieving the desired mixture of low speed ranges for slope/hill climbing and high speed ranges on the flat terrain surface.
[0005]	Hence, there exists a need for a drive assistant system for controlling the speed of a wheelchair in both slope/hill and the flat terrain surface.


Summary of the Invention

[0006]	The present invention overcomes the drawbacks in the prior art by providing a driving system for a powered wheelchair comprising a hand lever, a prime mover, and a two-speed gearbox that allows an user to operate the wheelchair at low speeds while climbing slopes/hills, and at high speeds when the wheelchair is on a flat terrain surface. In an embodiment, the prime mover is connected to the hand lever, and the two-speed gearbox is connected to the prime mover, in order to allow the user to operate the wheelchair at low speeds while climbing slopes/hills, and at high speeds when the wheelchair is on a flat terrain surface.
[0007]	In an embodiment, when the hand lever is pushed by an user of the wheelchair, the rotational movement of an input shaft is transferred to an output shaft through a first pinion gear and a first gear such that a male dog clutch and a female dog clutch are engaged, and a relative movement between the output shaft and a freewheel, allows the freewheel to rotate in an anticlockwise direction thereby providing a lesser gear ratio in the first gear so as to induce low torque on a wheel shaft of the wheelchair, to increase the speed of the wheelchair on the flat terrain surface.
[0008]	In another embodiment, when the hand lever is released by the user of the wheelchair, a rotational movement of the input shaft is transferred to the output shaft through a second pinion gear and a second gear such that the male dog clutch and the female dog clutch are disengaged, and the freewheel located in the hub of the second gear is locked in clockwise direction thereby providing higher gear ratio in the second gear to induce high torque on a wheel shaft of the wheelchair, to decrease the speed of the wheelchair while climbing slopes/hills.

Detailed Description of the Invention
[0013]	Reference will now be made in detail to the description of the present subject matter, one or more examples of which are shown in figures. Each example is provided to explain the subject matter and not a limitation. Various changes and modifications obvious to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the invention.
[0014]	Fig. 1a and Fig.1b illustrates a side view and a front view of a driving system with a prime mover and a two-speed gearbox incorporated on a front portion of a wheelchair for controlling a speed of a wheelchair, in accordance to one embodiment of the invention.
[0015]	As exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b, the driving system of powered wheelchair (100) comprises a hand lever (101), a prime mover (102), and a two-speed gearbox (103). The two-speed gearbox (103) is connected to the prime mover (102). In an embodiment, when the hand lever (101) is pushed by an user of the wheelchair (100), the rotational movement of an input shaft (112) is transferred to an output shaft (113) through a first pinion gear (107) and a first gear (109) so that a male dog clutch (105) and a female dog clutch (106) are engaged (as exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 2) and a relative movement between the output shaft (113) and a freewheel (111), allows the freewheel (111) to rotate in an anticlockwise direction thereby providing lesser gear ratio in the first gear (109) to induce low torque in a wheel shaft (100a) to increase the speed of the wheelchair (100) on a flat terrain surface.
[0016]	As exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b, the prime mover (102) is coupled to the two-speed gearbox (103) by drives for example sprockets and chains. The hand lever (101) is connected to the two-speed gearbox (103) by means of cable. 
[0017]	In another embodiment, when the hand lever (101) is released by the user of the wheelchair (100), a rotational movement of the input shaft (112) is transferred to the output shaft (113) through a second pinion gear (108) and a second gear (110) such that the male dog clutch (105) and the female dog clutch (106) are disengaged (as exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 3), and the freewheel (111) located in the hub of the second gear (110) is locked in a clockwise direction thereby providing higher gear ratio in the second gear (110) to induce high torque on the wheel shaft (100a) to reduce the speed of the wheelchair (100) while climbing a ramp.
[0018]	In an embodiment, the prime mover (102)is connected to the two-speed gearbox (103) and source to the prime mover (102) is driven from a battery.The driving system is mounted on a steering of the wheelchair (100).
[0019]	Thus, the two-speed gearbox (103) can shift conveniently between two gear ratios according to the circumstances. That is, when the wheelchair (100) is at flat terrain surface, and ramp (inclined) respectively.The shifting between two different gear ratios is done by a hand lever (101), i.e. whenever the wheelchair (100) is on the flat terrain surface and the user desires to go at a faster velocity than the user can shift to lowergear ratio. Thus, the two-speed gearbox (103) of the present invention improves the overall drivability and motor efficiency, but also downsize the battery and motor.
[0020]	Fig. 2 illustrates a front view of the two-speed gearbox (103) in which the male dog clutch (105) and a female dog clutch (106) are engaged, in accordance to one embodiment of the invention.
[0021]	As exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 2, when the user of the wheelchair (100) desires to go faster on the flat terrain surface, the user pushes the hand lever (101) attached to the two-speed gearbox (103). Once the hand lever (101) is pushed by the user, the rotational movement of an input shaft (112) is transferred to an output shaft (113) through a first pinion gear (107) and a first gear (109) such that the male dog clutch (105) slides over spline (104) to get engaged to the female dog clutch (106) and a relative movement between the output shaft (113) and a freewheel (111) located in the hub of the second gear (110) allows the freewheel (111) to rotate in the anticlockwise direction thereby providing a lesser gear ratio in the first gear (109) so as to increase the speed of the wheelchair (100) on a flat terrain surface as disclosed in the detailed description of FIG. 1.
[0022]	Fig. 3 illustrates a front view of two-speed gearbox (103) in which the male dog clutch (105) and the female dog clutch (106) are engaged, in accordance to another embodiment of the invention.
[0023]	In an embodiment, when the user of the wheelchair (100) is about to climb the ramp (incline) or any obstacle. The user releases the hand lever (101). Once the hand lever (101) is released by the user a rotational movement of the input shaft (112) is transferred to the output shaft (113) through a second pinion gear (108) and a second gear (110) such that the male dog clutch (105) and the female dog clutch (106) are disengaged and the freewheel (111) located in the hub of the second gear (110) is locked in a clockwise direction thereby providing higher gear ratio in the second gear (110) so as to induce high torque on the wheel shaft (100a) of the wheelchair (100) to reduce the speed of the wheelchair (100) while climbing a ramp as disclosed in the detailed description of Fig. 1.
[0024]	The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification, and thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and variations will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation illustrated and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
